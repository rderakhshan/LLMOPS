# Personal Assistant Application (Under construction)

## Overview

This application leverages **LangChain**, **Langraph**, and **Langsmit** to create an advanced **personal assistant**. The assistant is designed with a modular and extensible architecture to enable functionalities like:
- **Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines text, images, and other modalities for intelligent data retrieval and processing.
- **Question Answering**: Provides accurate answers based on input context using integrated language models.
- **Internet Search**: Accesses real-time web data to enhance responses.

The goal is to build a robust, adaptable assistant capable of handling complex queries with a mix of real-time and pre-processed information.

## Features

1. **Multimodal RAG**:
   - Supports retrieval and reasoning over diverse data types, including text, images, and structured data.
2. **Question Answering**:
   - Utilizes integrated language models for context-based answers.
3. **Internet Search**:
   - Retrieves live information from the web to answer queries.
4. **Modular Design**:
   - Designed to support easy integration of new components and capabilities.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
     ```
3. **API Keys**:
   - Ensure you have API keys for required services (e.g., OpenAI, search engines, cloud storage, etc.).
   - Place them in an `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key>
     SEARCH_API_KEY=<your_key>
     ```

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python app.py --test
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application
Start the application with:
```bash
python app.py
```

### Example Commands
- **Question Answering**:
  ```
  Assistant: What is the capital of France?
  ```
- **Multimodal RAG**:
  ```
  User: Summarize this document and provide insights.
  ```
- **Internet Search**:
  ```
  User: What's the latest news on AI advancements?
  ```

## Architecture

The application follows a **modular architecture** to enable scalability and ease of integration:

### Core Components
1. **LangChain**: Orchestrates LLM interactions and chaining of prompts.
2. **Langraph**: Manages graph-based reasoning and contextual dependencies.
3. **Langsmit**: Powers multimodal data processing and knowledge integration.

### Flow Diagram
1. Input (Text/Image/Query) →  
2. Data Retrieval (Langraph + Internet Search) →  
3. Processing (LangChain + Langsmit) →  
4. Response Generation.
